## Project Insights
Developed during a 36-hour hackathon, this project involved collaboration with a diverse team of innovators, addressing the challenge of identifying discrepancies in Quality Monitoring Data on OMMAS. Key outcomes include:

1. **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Developed to analyze data and identify discrepancies.
2. **Customizable Dashboard**: For visualizing and comparing data from various sources.
3. **Automated Data Processing Pipeline**: For efficient handling of large data volumes.
4. **NLP Techniques**: Implemented for in-depth data analysis and discrepancy identification.

## Future Scope
- Enhancement of the machine learning model for broader anomaly detection.
- Expansion of the data processing pipeline to include additional data sources.
- Further development of the dashboard for more interactive features.
- A new model revamp using BaaS (Backend as a Service) and FaaS (Function as a Service) technologies.
